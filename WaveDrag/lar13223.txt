 WAVDRAG- ZERO-LIFT WAVE DRAG OF COMPLEX AIRCRAFT CONFIGURATIONS

( NASA Langley Research Center )

     WAVDRAG calculates the supersonic zero-lift wave drag of complex air-
craft configurations. The numerical model of an aircraft is used through-
out the design process from concept to manufacturing. WAVDRAG incorpo-
rates extended geometric input capabilities to permit use of a more accu-
rate mathematical model. With WAVDRAG, the engineer can define aircraft
components as fusiform or nonfusiform in terms of non-intersecting con-
tours in any direction or more traditional parallel contours. In addition,
laterally asymmetric configurations can be simulated.

     The calculations in WAVDRAG are based on Whitcomb's area-rule com-
putation of equivalent-bodies, with modifications for supersonic speed.
Instead of using a single equivalent-body, WAVDRAG calculates a series of
equivalent-bodies, one for each roll angle. The total aircraft configura-
tion wave drag is the integrated average of the equivalent-body wave drags
through the full roll range of 360 degrees. WAVDRAG currently accepts up
to 30 user-defined components containing a maximum of 50 contours as geo-
metric input. Each contour contains a maximum of 50 points. The Mach num-
ber, angle-of-attack, and coordinates of angle-of-attack rotation are also
input. The program warns of any fusiform-body line segments having a slope
larger than the Mach angle. WAVDRAG calculates total drag and the wave-drag
coefficient of the specified aircraft configuration.

     WAVDRAG is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch execution and has been im-
plemented on a CDC CYBER 170 series computer with a central memory require-
ment of approximately 63K (octal) of 60 bit words. This program was devel-
oped in 1983.
