DESCRIPTION OF THE OUTPUT FILE FROM D2500

The main output from D2500 is the file wavedrag.out that 
may be scrolled to your screen or printed for examination.
Some additional files that are destined for printing are described
later.




FUSELAGE AREA DIDTRIBUTION

Regardless of how many points are used to define the fuselage, the program 
generates an enriched set of data that is actually used for the
calculations.


CONFIGURATION AREA BUILDUP BY COMPONENTS

The essence of the supersonic area rule is the calculation of the 
longitudinal distribution of area of the complete configuration at
different values of the oblique cutting angle theta. Tables are
provided for theta=-90,-45,0,45, and 90 degrees, although many other
angles are also used. Tables are provided with headers S(B),S(BW),
S(BWP),S(BWPF),S(BWPFC) showing the way different components of the
configuration contribute to the overall area distribution.
For some angles, the overall length may be greater than the difference
between the max and min values of x for the configuration.
This is a consequence of the oblique cutting planes.


OPTIMUM FUSELAGE AREA

If this is a design case, then the optimum fuselage distribution
subject to the constraints is printed next.


D/Q ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS ANGLES OF THETA

The area distribution at each theta is converted to an equivalent source
distribution and its drag is computed by Eminton's algorithm. The 
result for each theta is presented in the table.


ENTIRE AIRCRAFT D/Q AND CDW

These numbers are the real bottom line result of the program, namely
the zero-lift wave drag of the entire configuration.


BODY AREAS FOR NEXT CYCLE

If this is a design case, the next table shows the fuselage shape 
that will be used in the next cycle.


AREA DISTRIBUTION PLOTS

Several plot files are produced with names of s001.gnu, s002.gnu,...
that show the buildup of area for each cutting angle. These may be 
displayed with gnuplot as in  plot "s001.gnu" with lines. The order 
of the buildup is fuselage, wing, pod, fin, canard, same as in the
printed output.
