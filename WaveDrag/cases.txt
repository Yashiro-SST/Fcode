TEST CASES FOR D2500 - ZERO-LIFT WAVE DRAG PROGRAM

Test cases are provided to enable you to confirm the correct
operation of the program on your computer.

case1.inp  -  This is a simple case of a delta wing on a simple
   fuselage. The program is instructed to generate a new fuselage
   shape, subject to constraints at two positions. The original
   drag coefficient of xxx is reduced to yyy by the body modifications.


case2.inp  -  This is a supersonic transport with multiple Mach number
   runs. The wing has camber and twist, so there are lots of TZORD
   records. The over-the-wing pods have something to do with sonic
   boom reduction. There are several Mach number runs for the same
   configuration and this is controlled by the 1 in col 24 of the
   CASE record. For the last Mach number of 1.0, it is unnecessary to
   have NTHETA=16 as all the angles give the same result for M=1.


case3.inp  -  This is a supersonic transport configuration that shows 
   an example of fuselage optimization.


case4.inp  -  This is a supersonic transport with a blended non-circular
   fuselage and wing fins.
