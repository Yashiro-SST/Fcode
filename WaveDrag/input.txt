INPUT GUIDE FOR PROGRAM D2500                             \wavedrag\input.txt

     Input for the D2500 wave drag analysis program is in a formatted,
column-sensitive format.  Blanks in a field are interpreted as zeroes.  
All configurations are assumed to be symmetric with respect to the 
X-Z plane so that only the "positive y" half of the vehicle is defined.  
The positive direction of the y-axis is out the right wing.
X is positive rearward and z is positive upward.
The option exists to stack input files (see NCON on the Case Control 
Record) to reanalyze a configuration with minor geometry changes.  
For the second and successive configurations, the control Jx for 
unchanged components may be set to 2 to avoid repeating the input 
data for that component.

fields with a decimal point, with up to ten fields per record.  If
more than ten fields are required, additional records are used.

consists of a key word and a number or combination of numbers
identifying that record within the group.  For example, "WAFORG 3"
would be the record specifying the location of the third airfoil,
and "TZORD 3-2" might be the second record defining the mean camber
line for the third airfoil.  This identification is not used by
the program, but it is useful because all configuration data are
input in the same format, and it all looks alike.  Suggested
identifiers are provided.

THINGS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT:
  Wing, fin, canard longitudinal x-coordinates are non-dimensional, while 
  fuselage and pod x-coordinates are dimensional

  Thickness values for wing,fin,canard are half-thickness. If your wing
  has a maximum thickness of 12 percent, then the largest entry in
  WAFORD is 6.  ( A favorite error of beginners)
